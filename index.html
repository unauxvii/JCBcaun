      <p class="about">
        Hello! I’m Johanna Christine Castro Bacun, a passionate and driven individual with a strong interest in technology and innovation. I’m a 2025 graduate of Saint Louis University Laboratory High School, where I pursued the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strand. Currently, I am a college freshman at the University of the Cordilleras, majoring in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Web Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born on February 3, 2007, in Doha, Qatar, and spent eleven years studying at Philippine School Doha before moving to the Philippines in 2017. During the mid-2020 pandemic, I transferred to Saint Louis University, where I continued to develop my academic skills and broaden my perspective through new learning experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as I pursue my degree in Information Technology, I aim to refine my technical skills, explore creative solutions, and build a strong foundation for a future career in web development and digital innovation.
